# esh

esh aims to provide a driver for the G Pro X Superlight mouse from Logitech for linux, since there aren't any available I'm aware of.
The project will provide a cli and possibly a gui for various Linux distros.
Windows and macOS support are currently not planned, but may be added depending on my mood.

## Setup

Coming soon.
